<pre><code>@RunWith(Theories.class)
public class UserTest {
  @DataPoint public static String GOOD_USERNAME = "optimus";
  @DataPoint public static String USERNAME_WITH_SLASH = "optimus/prime";

  @Theory public void filenameIncludesUsername(String username) {
    assumeThat(username, not(containsString("/")));
    assertThat(new User(username).configFileName(), containsString(username));
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This makes it clear that the user's filename should be included in the
config file name, only if it doesn't contain a slash.  Another test
or theory might define what happens when a username does contain a slash.</p>

<p><code>UserTest</code> will attempt to run <code>filenameIncludesUsername</code> on 
every compatible <code>DataPoint</code> defined in the class.  If any of the
assumptions fail, the data point is silently ignored.  If all of the
assumptions pass, but an assertion fails, the test fails.</p>

<p>The support for Theories has been absorbed from the <a href="http://popper.tigris.org">Popper</a>
project, and <a href="http://popper.tigris.org/tutorial.html">more complete documentation</a> can be found
there.</p>

<p>Defining general statements in this way can jog the developer's memory
about other potential data points and tests, also allows <a href="http://www.junitfactory.org">automated
tools</a> to <a href="http://shareandenjoy.saff.net/2007/04/popper-and-junitfactory.html">search</a> for new, unexpected data
points that expose bugs.</p>

<h3>Other changes</h3>

<p>This release contains other bug fixes and new features.  Among them:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Annotated descriptions</p>

<p>Runner UIs, Filters, and Sorters operate on Descriptions of test
methods and test classes.  These Descriptions now include the
annotations on the original Java source element, allowing for richer
display of test results, and easier development of annotation-based
filters.</p></li>
<li><p>Bug fix (1715326): assertEquals now compares all Numbers using their
native implementation of <code>equals</code>.  This assertion, which passed in
4.3, will now fail:</p>
