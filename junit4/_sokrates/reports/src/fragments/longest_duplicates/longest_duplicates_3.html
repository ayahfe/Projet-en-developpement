If this isn't immediately possible, making dependencies explicit can often improve a design. <br />
For example, if a test fails when run in a different locale than the developer intended,
it can be fixed by explicitly passing a locale to the domain code.</p>

<p>However, sometimes this is not desirable or possible. <br />
It's good to be able to run a test against the code as it is currently written, 
implicit assumptions and all, or to write a test that exposes a known bug.
For these situations, JUnit now includes the ability to express "assumptions":</p>

<pre><code>import static org.junit.Assume.*

@Test public void filenameIncludesUsername() {
   assumeThat(File.separatorChar, is('/'));
   assertThat(new User("optimus").configFileName(), is("configfiles/optimus.cfg"));
}

@Test public void correctBehaviorWhenFilenameIsNull() {
   assumeTrue(bugFixed("13356"));  // bugFixed is not included in JUnit
   assertThat(parse(null), is(new NullDocument()));
}
